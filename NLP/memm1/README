The following script is used to generate a training file for the liblinear library.

the scripts takes as its input only the file for which we need the memm-train file.
the script generates 3 output files:
memm-train - used to run liblinear to generate model.
memm-featuremap - used in later stages for tagging.
tags.txt - used for label to english tag mapping

features names are like so:
w prefix means its a word feature.
pt - previous tag
ppt - previous previous tag
nw,nnw - next and next next word
pw, ppw - previous and prev prev word
s - suffix
p - prefix
all of the regexes are by their names, e.g. hyphen etc.


to create the model out of the training file simply run the following command:
java -Xmx1g -cp liblinear.jar de.bwaldvogel.liblinear.Train -s 0  memm-train memm-model
